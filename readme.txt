Yes, you can merge categories the same way you merge tags, by going to this URL on your site:

`/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=category`


== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip "merge-tags" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.
